TODO

- x-chart: sum_cols="col1/min|max|sum|avg ..."

- x-chart: show x-markers independent of of data.

- x-chart optimization: continuous mode
	- when all sum_cols are avg and shape is line* or area* and data is small
	enough that drawing is faster than grouping.

- let sqlpp tell xrowset when tables change.

- xrowset_table: derived from xrowset_sql.

- xrowset: gen col_map for self:insert_into() etc. from all non-r/o cols.


- mm: save logs (excluding debug lines) in partitioned tables.

- mm: alerts:
	events:
		- the app stopped sending procinfo
		- max proc on machine is > X % for Y s in a row
		- free ram on machine is < X MB
		- app rss is > X MB
	actions:
		- log alert
		- send email describing the situation
	complications:
		- prevent repeat email for the same alert type at intervals < X hours

- mm: auto-restart when lost contact (restart -f ?).

BUGS

- mm: align log queue entries to current time (maybe just send correct clock field?).

- http: http_gzip_encode thread is gc'ed but does not explicitly terminates.

THINK
- kbytes() with variable magnitude or max decimals?
- x-chart: sub-unit log-1024-based steps
